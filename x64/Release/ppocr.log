This can lead to incorrect clean and rebuild behavior.
  Building Custom Rule E:/PaddleOCR/deploy/cpp_infer/CMakeLists.txt
  CMake is re-running because E:/PaddleOCR/deploy/cpp_infer/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.

CUSTOMBUILD : CMake error : The current CMakeCache.txt directory E:/PaddleOCR/deploy/cpp_infer/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/tusky/Documents/Projects/PaddleOCR/PaddleOCR_2.5/deploy/cpp_infer/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CUSTOMBUILD : CMake error : The source "E:/PaddleOCR/deploy/cpp_infer/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/Users/tusky/Documents/Projects/PaddleOCR/PaddleOCR_2.5/deploy/cpp_infer/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
